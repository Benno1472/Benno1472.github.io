* dynamic planet model that slowly moves around a "sun"
* each planet
    * is a clickable object that redirects the user to another page
    * rotates at a slightly different speed

#### About Me Page
* fireworks simulation, when a firework explodes a box fades in where in explodes and shows a little fact about me (persistent throughout the simulation)
* fireworks can't explode in the same place
* option to show all facts

#### Projects Page
* boids simulation where each boid links to a specific project
* a new boid spawns in (random pos) every x amount of frames
* hovering over a boid pauses the simulation, brings up a textbox with a project title, project description and link
* potentially have large text that says "projects" and boids have obstacle avoidance towards that text
* boundaries so boids stay within the screen

###### Tools
* Use `P5.js` for creating the simulations
