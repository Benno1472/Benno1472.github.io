My name is Benjamin Leszczynski, I'm 19 years old and enjoy programming, learning about orbital mechanics and spaceflight, watching animated movies and working-on/driving my Subaru.

I'm knowledgable in several programming languages including Python, Javascript, Java and C. Recently I've been learning about Database Management Systems and experimenting with SQlite aswell as MongoDB.

I'm currently attending the university of alberta and am working towards getting my degree in computing science.

I like to creatively code and work on fun projects, Daniel Shiffman has been a huge inspiration for me.

One of my favourite programming projects I made in highschool was a chrome extension that allowed users to draw ontop of websites with their mouse.

I have an old right-hand-drive Subaru imported from Japan which breaks down a lot.

My dads side of the family is from Poland and my moms side is from New Zealand.

I can be contacted via email at leszczynskiBen@gmail.com

My favourite video game is a pirate game called Sea Of Thieves

I got into spaceflight by watching a STEM streamer on Twitch called EJ_SA, he taught me about optimzing orbital transfers, supersonic retropropulsion, aerobraking and much more.

I have a small titanium section from an SR-71 blackbird designated Nasa 831 (USAF 64-17956).

My favourite fighter jet is the F-104 Starfighter because of it's speed and unique howling produced by it's J-79 turbojet engine and intake.

One time when I visited New Zealand, I went surfing in the ocean one day and the next day I went snowboarding in the mountains.

I can solve many types of rubiks style cubes; 3x3, 2x2, pyraminx and snake cube. I can't yet solve the 4x4 cube by memory yet.

I'm bilingual and fluently speak English and French, I still don't enjoy french grammar rules. I once learnt to juggle for a french project too.

I built my gaming pc with my dad and it booted up on the first try.
